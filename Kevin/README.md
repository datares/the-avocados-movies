### Exploratory Analysis: Exclusive Content offered by each Movie Streaming Service: 
What differentiates their top 10 list? How popular are the top movies? And what percentage of their views go towards exclusive platform content?

List of Data Sets of Interest:
- Comparison of movies that each service offers + movies IMDb and rotten tomatoes score: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney
- ImDB Rating of 3 Decades worth of movies: https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies
- Another IMDb data base, bigger than the previous set, includes data about movie titles, actors, rating score, and also includes information regarding the audience and user's perspetive on the data: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset
- TV Shows on each of the subscription services: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney

#### Analysis of TV shows offered by each subscription service
 First, in order to determine and rank which streaming service was the best, I wanted to look into how many TV Shows were actually cross platform. Are there alot? Or relatively few?
 
According to website source data, 
- Netflix has 1940 TV Shows and 3781 Movies
- Hulu has 1650 TV Shows
- Amazon Prime has 1981 TV Shows
 
 Then, data was found that plotted the number of shows, the average rotten tomato score, and the average IMDb score against each streaming service. 

#### Struggles
- How do I determine a top watch list if I have no metric to go by in terms of popularity (# of times watched, time on home page, etc.)?
- Should we create an average score compiled from both the IMDb and the rotten tomatoes score? What happens also if there is one value missing from either of those?
