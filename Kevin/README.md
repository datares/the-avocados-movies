### Exploratory Analysis: Exclusive Content offered by each Movie Streaming Service: 
What differentiates their top 10 list? How popular are the top movies? And what percentage of their views go towards exclusive platform content?

List of Data Sets of Interest:
- Comparison of movies across streaming service: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney
- Comparison of tv shows across streaming service: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney


- ImDB Rating of 3 Decades worth of movies: https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies
- Another IMDb data base, bigger than the previous set, includes data about movie titles, actors, rating score, and also includes information regarding the audience and user's perspetive on the data: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset

#### Analysis of movies and TV shows offered by each subscription service
 First, in order to determine and rank which streaming service was the best, I wanted to look into how many movies and TV Shows were actually cross platform. Are there alot? Or relatively few?
 
According to website source data, 
- Netflix has 3781 Movies and 1940 TV Shows
- Hulu has 2500 movies and 1650 TV Shows
- Amazon Prime has 18,000 movies and 1981 TV Shows
 
 Then, data was found that plotted the number of movies and TV shows, the average rotten tomato score, and the average IMDb score against each streaming service. 

#### Struggles
- How do I determine a top watch list if I have no metric to go by in terms of popularity (# of times watched, time on home page, etc.)?
- Should we create an average score compiled from both the IMDb and the rotten tomatoes score? What happens also if there is one value missing from either of those?

- Look at IMDb data to see # of users, # of comments, # of reviews, etc. 

#### Next steps:
- I think it would be cute if we used the same color palette for all of our graphs, Netflix can have red scheme, Disney blue, Hulu greenish?, and PrimeVideo can be grey/dark green xD
